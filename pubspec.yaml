  # We have to pin analyzer to 0.27.1 because the flx package depends
  # on pointycastle which depends on reflectable which depends on
  # analyzer 0.27.1 and if we don't pin it here, then different
  # packages end up bringing in different analyzer versions which
  # results in 'flutter analyze' (which uses an entirely different
  # analyzer, by the way!) complaining about the inconsistency.
