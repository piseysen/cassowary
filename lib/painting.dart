/// The Flutter painting library.

/// This library includes a variety of classes that wrap the Flutter
/// engine's painting API for more specialised purposes, such as painting scaled
/// images, interpolating between shadows, painting borders around boxes, etc.
///
/// This library depends only on the core Dart libraries and animation.dart.
/// Note: animation.dart depends on the `newton` package.
